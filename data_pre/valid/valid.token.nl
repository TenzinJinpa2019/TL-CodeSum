This method determines which menu items get to be 'action items' that will appear in an action bar and which items should be 'overflow items' in a secondary menu The rules are as follows: <p> Items are considered for inclusion in the order specified within the menu There is a limit of m Max Action Items as a total count, optionally including the overflow menu button itself This is a soft limit; if an item shares a group I D with an item previously included as an action item, the new item will stay with its group and become an action item itself even if it breaks the max item count limit This is done to limit the conceptual complexity of the items presented within an action bar Only a few unrelated concepts should be presented to the user in this space, and groups are treated as a single concept <p> There is also a hard limit of consumed measurable space: m Action Width Limit This limit may be broken by a single item that exceeds the remaining space, but no further items may be added If an item that is part of a group cannot fit within the remaining measured width, the entire group will be demoted to overflow This is done to ensure room for navigation and other affordances in the action bar as well as reduce general U I clutter <p> The space freed by demoting a full group cannot be consumed by future menu items Once items begin to overflow, all future items become overflow items as well This is to avoid inadvertent reordering that may break the app's intended design

Helper called by generated code to construct default values for string fields <p> The protocol compiler does not actually contain a U T F-8 decoder -- it just pushes U T F-8-encoded text around without touching it The one place where this presents a problem is when generating Java string literals Unicode characters in the string literal would normally need to be encoded using a Unicode escape sequence, which would require decoding them To get around this, protoc instead embeds the U T F-8 bytes into the generated code and leaves it to the runtime library to decode them <p> It gets worse, though If protoc just generated a byte array, like: new byte[] {0x12, 0x34, 0x56, 0x78} Java actually generates *code* which allocates an array and then fills in each value This is much less efficient than just embedding the bytes directly into the bytecode To get around this, we need another work-around String literals are embedded directly, so protoc actually generates a string literal corresponding to the bytes The easiest way to do this is to use the I S O-8859-1 character set, which corresponds to the first 256 characters of the Unicode range Protoc can then use good old C Escape to generate the string <p> So we have a string literal which represents a set of bytes which represents another string This function -- string Default Value -- converts from the generated string to the string we actually want The generated code calls this automatically

Called by the lookup Listener's notify() method Checks the event sequence number and, based on whether or not a "gap" is found in in the event sequence, creates and places on the queue, either a Lookup Task (if a gap was found) or a Notify Task Recall that the Event specification states that if the sequence numbers of two successive events differ by only 1, then one can be assured that no events were missed On the other hand, if the difference is greater than 1 (the sequence contains a "gap"), then one or more events may -- or may not -- have been missed Thus, if a gap is found in the events, although it's possible that no events were missed, this method takes the conservative approach by assuming events were missed When this method determines that an event may have been missed, it requests a current "snapshot" of the given Service Registrar's state by queueing the execution of a Lookup Task Since this method can safely assume that no events have been missed if it finds no gaps in the event sequence, this method queues the notification of the entity by requesting the execution of a Notify Event Task Note that when a lookup service is discovered, this utility registers with that lookup service's event mechanism for service events related to the services of interest Upon registering with the event mechanism, a data structure (of type Event Reg) containing information about that registration is placed in a Map for later processing when events do arrive If the timing is right, it is possible that a service event may arrive between the time the registration is made and the time the Event Reg is stored in the map Thus, this method may find that the event Reg Map does not contain an element corresponding to the event this method is currently processing In that case, this method will do nothing It will simply return so that the service referenced in the event can be discovered using the snapshot returned by the Lookup Task that is ultimately queued by the Register Listener Task (whose listener registration caused this method to be invoked in the first place)

Test the named character encoding to verify that it converts A S C I I characters correctly We have to use an A S C I I based encoding, or else the Network Clients will not work correctly in E B C D I C based systems However, we cannot just use A S C I I or I S O8859_1 universally, because in Asian locales, non- A S C I I characters may be embedded in otherwise A S C I I based protocols (eg H T T P) The specifications ( R F C2616, 2398) are a little ambiguous in this matter For instance, R F C2398 [part 2 1] says that the H T T P request U R I should be escaped using a defined mechanism, but there is no way to specify in the escaped string what the original character set is It is not correct to assume that U T F-8 is always used (as in U R Ls in H T M L 4 0) For this reason, until the specifications are updated to deal with this issue more comprehensively, and more importantly, H T T P servers are known to support these mechanisms, we will maintain the current behavior where it is possible to send non- A S C I I characters in their original unescaped form

Adds the specified node to the list of selected nodes The list of selected nodes is guaranteed to be sorted in the same direction that the nodes appear in the tree We only allow nodes to be in the selected list that are peers in the tree (we do not allow selects to span multiple depths in the tree <p/> Behavior: If no modifier key is depressed, the list of selected nodes will be set to contain just the node passed to this method <p/> Shift select: If shift is depressed, then we attempt to do a continuous range select If there exists one or more nodes in the selected nodes list, we test if the node falls within the list If it does not fall within, we connect the contiguous range of nodes from the specified node to the nearest selected node If the node falls within the list, we do a continuous range selection to the L A S T node that was selected, not the closest <p/> C T R L select: If C T R L is depressed then we simply search for the insertion point of the specified node in the already sorted select list If the node is already present, then we remove it and unselect the node If it was not present, then we insert the node at the appropriate spot in the array and select it

Main worker run loop Repeatedly gets tasks from queue and executes them, while coping with a number of issues: 1 We may start out with an initial task, in which case we don't need to get the first one Otherwise, as long as pool is running, we get tasks from get Task If it returns null then the worker exits due to changed pool state or configuration parameters Other exits result from exception throws in external code, in which case completed Abruptly holds, which usually leads process Worker Exit to replace this thread 2 Before running any task, the lock is acquired to prevent other pool interrupts while the task is executing, and clear Interrupts For Task Run called to ensure that unless pool is stopping, this thread does not have its interrupt set 3 Each task run is preceded by a call to before Execute, which might throw an exception, in which case we cause thread to die (breaking loop with completed Abruptly true) without processing the task 4 Assuming before Execute completes normally, we run the task, gathering any of its thrown exceptions to send to after Execute We separately handle Runtime Exception, Error (both of which the specs guarantee that we trap) and arbitrary Throwables Because we cannot rethrow Throwables within Runnable run, we wrap them within Errors on the way out (to the thread's Uncaught Exception Handler) Any thrown exception also conservatively causes thread to die 5 After task run completes, we call after Execute, which may also throw an exception, which will also cause thread to die According to J L S Sec 14 20, this exception is the one that will be in effect even if task run throws The net effect of the exception mechanics is that after Execute and the thread's Uncaught Exception Handler have as accurate information as we can provide about any problems encountered by user code

This method deals with the fact, that the decoding process doesn't always yield a single most likely value The current error correction implementation doesn't deal with erasures very well, so it's better to provide a value for these ambiguous codewords instead of treating it as an erasure The problem is that we don't know which of the ambiguous values to choose We try decode using the first value, and if that fails, we use another of the ambiguous values and try to decode again This usually only happens on very hard to read and decode barcodes, so decoding the normal barcodes is not affected by this

Returns node holding key or null if no such, clearing out any deleted nodes seen along the way Repeatedly traverses at base-level looking for key starting at predecessor returned from find Predecessor, processing base-level deletions as encountered Some callers rely on this side-effect of clearing deleted nodes Restarts occur, at traversal step centered on node n, if: (1) After reading n's next field, n is no longer assumed predecessor b's current successor, which means that we don't have a consistent 3-node snapshot and so cannot unlink any subsequent deleted nodes encountered (2) n's value field is null, indicating n is deleted, in which case we help out an ongoing structural deletion before retrying Even though there are cases where such unlinking doesn't require restart, they aren't sorted out here because doing so would not usually outweigh cost of restarting (3) n is a marker or n's predecessor's value field is null, indicating (among other possibilities) that find Predecessor returned a deleted node We can't unlink the node because we don't know its predecessor, so rely on another call to find Predecessor to notice and return some earlier predecessor, which it will do This check is only strictly needed at beginning of loop, (and the b value check isn't strictly needed at all) but is done each iteration to help avoid contention with other threads by callers that will fail to be able to change links, and so will retry anyway The traversal loops in do Put, do Remove, and find Near all include the same three kinds of checks And specialized versions appear in find First, and find Last and their variants They can't easily share code because each uses the reads of fields held in locals occurring in the orders they were performed
